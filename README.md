# The-Injure-Soldier

It's a game based on decisions where you have to make your choices wisely if you want to survive.

This is my first game project 100% done.
I'm taking a course with the intention of learning more and more, and this was our first project.
I think it's importante to put it in here because a game developer always have to be proud of your first game ever.
The trend is always to improve, but always remembering where it all started.
